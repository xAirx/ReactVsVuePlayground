/* Letâ€™s say the user is on Landing page.
We know in advanced that the user can go to only page a, b, or c.
So, we prefetch the data for those pages immediately after the data on Landing page is loaded.
So, when the user goes to, for example, page a, it is already loaded and the experience is very smooth. */
